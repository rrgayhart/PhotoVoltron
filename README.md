# PhotoVoltron

Simple Rails Application to Connect Solar PV Equations with Solutions.

## WARNING

This project is created to connect existing resources for Solar PV installation and to recreate some of the mathematical processes used in planning PV projects.

<b> This application was NOT created by electricians and cannot be used as an installation manual. Solar PV is EXTREMELY dangerous and usually illegal to install without an excellent working knowledge of electricity and the grid.
<p>
Additionally, we are not mathematicians -- so all calculations are subject to possible mathematical errors. Use this tool at your own discretion
